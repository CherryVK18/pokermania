## 🤖 How to Create a Poker Bot

1. Inherit from the `CountingBot` base class.
2. Override the `declare_action()` method.
3. Register your bot and simulate games using `setup_config()` and `start_poker()`.

### Example: Random Bot

```python
class RandomBot(CountingBot):
    def declare_action(self, valid_actions, hole_card, round_state):
        # Randomly selects call, raise or fold
        ...
```

## 🧠 Advanced Bot Strategies

* **AggressiveBot**: Always raises with max possible amount.
* **CautiousBot**: Calls if pot is small, otherwise folds.
* **GeneralPlayer**: Uses Monte Carlo simulation to estimate hand strength.
* **AggressivePlayer**: Learns from opponent's behavior to counter bluffing.
